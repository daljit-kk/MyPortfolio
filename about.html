    <h1><span id="dynamic-text">Curiousity</span> That Can't Be Contained.</h1>
    <h1></h1><p class="problem">Daljit Kaur Khehra, Student RGD, is an emerging multidisciplinary designer with experience creating solutions for the education, wellness, and technology sectors across studio, start-up, and corporate environments. Working in these industries, Daljit has learned the art of taking highly technical information and translating it visually into engaging content different audiences can understand, pushing the envelope while working within brand guidelines, and executing projects from concept to completion within tight deadlines.</p>
<p class="solution">In an era where flat, cookie-cutter design solutions are becoming the new norm, Daljit is driven by a commitment to innovation, creativity, and high-quality design and storytelling, backed by an insight-driven approach, regardless of the medium. Whether it’s a logo, package design, or video, thorough research into her audience, competitors, and market drives every decision, and her dedication to continuous learning makes her an asset to any project she joins. Over the past two years, Daljit’s work has been selected by the Velma Morrison Center, St. Clair College, St. Clair College Research & Innovation, and Rocket Innovation Studio (part of Rocket Companies). Moving forward, Daljit aims to influence content and overall strategic direction in the design and advertising space. </p>
